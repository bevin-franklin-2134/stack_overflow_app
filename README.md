## Linking Within Documentation

Our API documentation uses relative paths for internal links. This means that when you click a link, it will point to another file within the `doc/api` directory, rather than an external URL.

For example, if you see a link for "Other Page" in <p>[The HTML to inject.](doc/api/index.html)</p>`index.html`, clicking it will load the content of `other_page.html` within the same browser window.

**(Optional) If using target="_top" for specific links:**

In some cases, you might see links that open in a new browser tab. This is intentional for specific scenarios. However, most links within the documentation use relative paths for a seamless browsing experience.
